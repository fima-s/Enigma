# Enigma
Realisation of famous german World War II encryption machine Enigma with plug board and interface, using Qt framework. By using a plug board the strength of encryption increases by orders of magnitude. 
For example if you use all 10 pairs of letters on plug board encryption strength will be about 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 variants on one letter in your messeage (!). 
By the using of simple functions for encryption and decryption been achieved colossal speed of encryption/ decryption. If we have text wich size like a Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen with about 570 000 letters without a spaces, in Enigma such text will encrypt in less than a second on i5 4570.
